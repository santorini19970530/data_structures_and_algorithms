# Searching Algorithms

## What is searching?

- in computer science, searching is the process of finding an itme with specified properties from a collection of items.

- the items may be stored as records in a database, simple data elements in arrays, text in files, nodes in trees, vertices and edges in graphs, or they may be elements of other search spaces.

## Why do we need searching?

- Searching is one of the core computer science algorithms

- we know that today's computers store a lot of information

- to retrive this information proficiently we need very efficient searching algorithms

- there are certain ways of organizing the data tha improves the seaching process

- that means if we keep the data in proper order, it is easy to search the required element

- sorting is one of the techniques for making the elements ordered
